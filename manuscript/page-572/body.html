wish is it you have?" she inquired, "do tell me, and it will be safe
enough with me."</p><p>"You are, my dear sister-in-law, a heroine among women," observed Mrs.
Ch'in, "so much so that those famous men, with sashes and official hats,
cannot excel you; how is it that you're not aware of even a couple of
lines of common adages, of that trite saying, 'when the moon is full, it
begins to wane; when the waters are high, they must overflow?' and of
that other which says that 'if you ascend high, heavy must be your
fall.' Our family has now enjoyed splendour and prosperity for already
well-nigh a century, but a day comes when at the height of good fortune,
calamity arises; and if the proverb that 'when the tree falls, the
monkeys scatter,' be fulfilled, will not futile have been the reputation
of culture and old standing of a whole generation?"</p></div> </div>
