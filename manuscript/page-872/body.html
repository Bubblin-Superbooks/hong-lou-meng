perceiving not one of them about bethought himself of a small reading
room, which existed in previous days on this side, in which was
suspended a picture of a beauty so artistically executed as to look
life-like. "On such a bustling day as this," he reasoned, "it's pretty
certain, I fancy, that there will be no one in there; and that beautiful
person must surely too feel lonely, so that it's only right that I
should go and console her a bit." With these thoughts, he hastily betook
himself towards the side-house yonder, and as soon as he came up to the
window, he heard the sound of groans in the room. Pao-y� was really
quite startled. "What!" (he thought), "can that beautiful girl,
possibly, have come to life!" and screwing up his courage, he licked a
hole in the paper of the window and peeped in. It was not she, however,
who had come to life, but Ming Yen holding down a girl and likewise
indulging in what the Monitory Dream Fairy had taught him.</p></div> </div>
