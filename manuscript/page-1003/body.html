<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>"You needn't dread her!" Chia Lien urged; "wait till my monkey is up,
and I'll take this jealous woman, and beat her to atoms; and she'll then
know what stuff I'm made of. She watches me just as she would watch a
thief! and she's only to hobnob with men, and I'm not to say a word to
any girl! and if I do say aught to a girl, or get anywhere near one, she
must at once give way to suspicion. But with no regard to younger
brothers or nephews, to young and old, she prattles and giggles with
them, and doesn't entertain any fear that I may be jealous; but
henceforward I too won't allow her to set eyes upon any man."</p><p>"If she be jealous, there's every reason," P'ing Erh answered, "but for
you to be jealous on her account isn't right. Her conduct is really
straightforward, and her deportment upright, but your conduct is
actuated by an evil heart, so much so that even I don't feel my heart at
ease, not to say anything of her."</p></div> </div>
