more brains than this, by and by when you have to give any answers in
the golden hall, to the questions (of the examiner), you will, really,
forget (the very first four names) of Chao, Oh'ien, Sun and Li (out of

remember the lines, ready-made though they were and staring at me in my
very eyes! Sister, you really can be styled my teacher, little though
you may have taught me, and I'll henceforward address you by no other
name than 'teacher,' and not call you 'sister' any more!"</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Don't you yet hurry to go on," Pao-ch'ai again</p></div> </div>
