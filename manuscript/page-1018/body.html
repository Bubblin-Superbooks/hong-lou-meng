<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">choice of
plays?"</p><p>At these words, the whole company had a hearty laugh; after which,
Tai-y�, at length, marked off a play; next in order following Pao-y�,
Shih Hsiang-y�n, Ying-ch'un, T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un, widow Li Wan, and
the rest, each and all of whom made a choice of plays, which were sung
in the costumes necessary for each. When the time came to take their
places at the banquet, dowager lady Chia bade Pao-ch'ai make another
selection, and Pao-ch'ai cast her choice upon the play: "Lu Chih-shen,
in a fit of drunkenness stirs up a disturbance up the Wu T'ai mountain;"
whereupon Pao-y� interposed, with the remark: "All you fancy is to
choose plays of this kind;" to which Pao-ch'ai rejoined, "You've
listened to plays all these years to no avail! How could you know the
beauties of this play? the stage effect is grand, but what is still
better are the apt and elegant passages in it."</p></div> </div>
