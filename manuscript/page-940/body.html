exertions in waiting upon you from morning to night, be also allowed
some rest; while the young servant girls, on the other hand, have
likewise been on duty the whole day long, and shouldn't they even at

was another Hsi Jen, he consequently put on a smile and remarked: "I'll
sit in here, so you had better set your mind at ease and go!"</p><p>"Since you remain in here, there's less need for me to go," resumed She

rejoined; "this morning you said that your head itched, and now that you
have nothing to do, I may as well comb it for you."</p></div> </div>
