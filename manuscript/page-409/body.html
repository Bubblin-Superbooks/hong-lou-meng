it on. The girl promptly took the hood, made of deep red cloth, and
shaking it out of its folds, she put it on Pao-y�'s head.</p><p>"That will do," hastily exclaimed Pao-y�. "You stupid thing! gently a
bit; is it likely you've never seen any one put one on before? let me do

stood on the edge of the couch. Pao-y� eagerly approached her, and
Tai-y� carefully kept the cap, to which his hair was bound, fast down,
and taking the hood she rested its edge on the circlet round his
forehead. She then raised the ball of crimson velvet, which was as large
as a walnut, and put it in such a way that, as it waved tremulously, it
should appear outside the hood. These arrangements completed she cast a
look for a while at what she had done. "That's right now," she added,
"throw your wrapper over you!"</p></div> </div>
