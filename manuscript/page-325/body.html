that she had no idea how to express herself in a decent manner, she
readily interrupted her with a smile. "You needn't mention anything,"
she observed, "I'm well aware of how things stand;" and addressing
herself to Mrs. Chou, she inquired, "Has this old lady had breakfast,
yes or no?"</p><p>Old goody Liu hurried to explain. "As soon as it was daylight," she
proceeded, "we started with all speed on our way here, and had we even
so much as time to have any breakfast?"</p><p>Lady Feng promptly gave orders to send for something to eat. In a short
while Chou Jui's wife had called for a table of viands for the guests,
which was laid in the room on the eastern side, and then came to take
goody Liu and Pan Erh over to have their repast.</p></div> </div>
