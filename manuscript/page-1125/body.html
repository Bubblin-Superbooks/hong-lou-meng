soon it was dawn, he got up, washed his face, and came to the main
street, outside the south gate, and purchasing some musk from a

immense brooms in their hands, engaged in that place in sweeping the
court. But as he suddenly caught sight of Chou Jui's wife appear outside
the door, and call out to the young boys; "Don't sweep now, our lady is
coming out," Chia Y�n eagerly walked up to her and inquired, with a face
beaming with smiles: "Where's aunt Secunda going to?"</p></div> </div>
