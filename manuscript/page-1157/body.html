three-legged table. 'Dullness' was consistently spelled 'dulness' and is
left thus. 'Decrepit' was consistently spelled 'decrepid' and is left
thus. 'Dote, dotes,' etc. was consistently spelled 'doat, doats,' etc.
and is left thus. 'License' is spelled once thus and once 'licence.' The
word 'speciality' appears only once, and that is the proper British
spelling.</p><p>Whenever a proper name normally contained an umlaut we attempted to
supply it in the instances where it was missing; this was most common
with the name Pao-yï¿½. There were also variations of use of apostrophes
in proper names, and many were corrected. Neither of these is
listed in the errata above.]</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
