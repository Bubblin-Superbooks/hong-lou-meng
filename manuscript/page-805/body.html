as I know that you're loth to give me anything, what do you say to my
returning even this purse?"</p><p>With these words, he threw the purse in her lap and walked off; which

dashed down the scissors and wiped her tears: "You needn't," she urged,
"be kind to me at one moment, and unkind at another; if you wish to have
a tiff, why then let's part company!" But as she spoke, she lost control
over her temper, and, jumping on her bed, she lay with her face turned
towards the inside, and set to work drying her eyes.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Pao-y� could not refrain from approaching her.</p></div> </div>
