earnestly entreat you to spare me this time! I've indeed said what I
shouldn't; but if I had any intention to insult you, I'll throw myself
to-morrow into the pond, and let the scabby-headed turtle eat me up, so
that I become transformed into a large tortoise. And when you shall have
by and by become the consort of an officer of the first degree, and you
shall have fallen ill from old age and returned to the west, I'll come
to your tomb and bear your stone tablet for ever on my back!"</p><p>As he uttered these words, Lin Tai-y� burst out laughing with a sound of
"pu ch'ih," and rubbing her eyes, she sneeringly remarked: "I too can
come out with this same tune; but will you now still go on talking
nonsense? Pshaw! you're, in very truth, like a spear-head, (which looks)
like silver, (but is really soft as) wax!"</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Go on, go on!" Pao-y� smiled after this remark;</p></div> </div>
