washing the slab, why shouldn't you at once make the needful
arrangements, so that neither you nor I may idle our time? And as we
shall be able to come together often and talk matters over, and set at
the same time our parents' minds at ease, and to enjoy the pleasure of
friendship, won't it be a profitable thing!"</p></div> </div>
