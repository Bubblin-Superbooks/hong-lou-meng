by the young ladies, the text of which is given below.</p><p>The lines written by Ying Ch'un on the tablet of "Boundless spirits and
blissful heart" were:</p><p>A park laid out with scenery surpassing fine and rare!
Submissive to thy will, on boundless bliss bashful I write!
Who could believe that yonder scenes in this world found a share!
Will not thy heart be charmed on thy visit by the sight?</p><p>These are the verses by T'an Ch'un on the tablet of "All nature vies in
splendour":</p><p>Of aspect lofty and sublime is raised a park of fame!
Honoured with thy bequest, my shallow lore fills me with shame.
No words could e'er amply exhaust the beauteous skill,
For lo! in very truth glory and splendour all things fill!</p><p>Thus runs Hsi Ch'un's stanza on the tablet of the "Conception of
literary compositions":</p></div> </div>
