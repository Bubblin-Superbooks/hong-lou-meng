Chia explained, in my hearing yesterday, that having made inquiries
about all their ages and their birthdays, she learnt that cousin Hsï¿½eh
would this year be fifteen, and that though this was not the birthday,
which made her of age, she could anyhow well be regarded as being on the
dawn of the year, in which she would gather up her hair, so that our
dowager lady enjoined that her anniversary should, as a matter of
course, be celebrated, unlike that of cousin Lin."</p><p>"Well, in that case," Chia Lien suggested, "you had better make a few
additions to what was done for cousin Lin!"</p><p>"That's what I too am thinking of," lady Feng replied, "and that's why
I'm asking your views; for were I, on my own hook, to add anything you
would again feel hurt for my not have explained things to you."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"That will do, that will do!" Chia Lien rejoined</p></div> </div>
