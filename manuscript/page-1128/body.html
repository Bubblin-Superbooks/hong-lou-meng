I've an excellent friend with considerable money of his own at home, who
recently kept a perfumery shop; but as he obtained, by purchase, the
rank of deputy sub-prefect, he was, the other day, selected for a post
in Yunnan, in some prefecture or other unknown to me; whither he has

such valuable articles, as these, were all presented to relatives or
friends; and that's why it is that I came in for some baroos camphor and

a present to any one, there was no one good enough to use such perfumes.
