Tai-ju, you, sir, are the head in this school, and every one looks to
you to take action. Had all the pupils been at fault, those who deserved
a beating should have been beaten, and those who merited punishment
should have been punished! and why did you wait until things came to
such a pass, and didn't even exercise any check?"</p><p>"I blew them up," pleaded Chia Jui, "but not one of them would listen."</p><p>"I'll speak out, whether you, worthy sir, resent what I'm going to say
or not," ventured Li Kuei. "It's you, sir, who all along have after all
had considerable blame attached to your name; that's why all these young
men wouldn't hear you! Now if this affair is bruited, until it reaches
Mr. Chia Tai-ju's ears, why even you, sir, will not be able to escape
condemnation; and why don't you at once make up your mind to disentangle
the ravelled mess and dispel all trouble and have done with it!"</p></div> </div>
