<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>In the interior of the Chiang Yï¿½n house are hushed all clamorous din
and noise.
The sheen, which from Selene flows, pervades the windows of carnation
gauze.
The moss-locked, streaked rocks shelter afford to the cranes, plunged
in sleep.
The dew, blown on the t'ung tree by the well, doth wet the roosting
rooks.
Wrapped in a quilt, the maid comes the gold phoenix coverlet to
spread.
The girl, who on the rails did lean, on her return drops the
kingfisher flowers!
This quiet night his eyes in sleep he cannot close, as he doth long
for wine.
The smoke is stifled, and the fire restirred, when tea is ordered to
be brewed.</p><p>The picture of a winter night is in this strain:</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The sleep of the plum trees, the dream of the bamboos the third watch
have already reached.
Under the embroidered quilt and the kingfisher coverlet one can't
sleep for the cold.
The shadow of fir trees pervades the court, but cranes are all that
meet the eye.
Both far</p></div> </div>
