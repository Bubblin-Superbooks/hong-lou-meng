<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">remembered the line written by an old poet:</p><p>"What time the smell of flowers wafts itself into man, one knows the
day is warm.</p><p>"And as this waiting-maid's surname was Hua (flower), I readily gave her

"change it and have done; and you, sir, needn't lose your temper over
such a trivial matter!"</p><p>"It doesn't really matter in the least," Chia Cheng continued; "so that
there's no necessity of changing it; but it's evident that Pao-y�
doesn't apply his mind to legitimate pursuits, but mainly devotes his
energies to such voluptuous expressions and wanton verses!" And as he
finished these words, he abruptly shouted out: "You brute-like child of
retribution! Don't you yet get out of this?"</p></div> </div>
