place?"</p><p>"There's no further need for deliberation," the company rejoined; "for
this is just the very spot fit for the three words 'Wu Ling Spring.'"</p><p>"This too is matter-of-fact!" Chia Cheng objected laughingly, "and

characters implying 'An old cottage of a man of the Ch'in dynasty?'"</p><p>"This is still more exceedingly plain!" interposed Pao-yï¿½. "'The old
cottage of a man of the Ch'in dynasty' is meant to imply a retreat from
revolution, and how will it suit this place? Wouldn't the four
characters be better denoting 'an isthmus with smart weed, and a stream
with flowers'?"</p></div> </div>
