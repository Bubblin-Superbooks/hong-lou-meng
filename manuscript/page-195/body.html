the succeeding day, it came about that the kidnapper again sold her to
the Hs�eh family! Had he disposed of her to any other party, no harm
would anyhow have resulted; but this young gentleman Hs�eh, who is
nicknamed by all, 'the Foolish and overbearing Prince,' is the most
perverse and passionate being in the whole world. What is more, he
throws money away as if it were dust. The day on which he gave the
thrashing with blows like falling leaves and flowing water, he dragged
(<em>lit</em>. pull alive, drag dead) Ying Lien away more dead than alive,
by sheer force, and no one, even up to this date, is aware whether she
be among the dead or the living. This young Feng had a spell of empty
happiness; for (not only) was his wish not fulfilled, but on the
contrary he spent money and lost his life; and was not this a lamentable
case?"</p></div> </div>
