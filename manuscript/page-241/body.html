went on to implore her permission again and again, until the Fairy
casting her eye upon the tablet of the board in front of her observed,

the Board of Ill-fated lives; and that on each side was a scroll with
the inscription:</p><p>Upon one's self are mainly brought regrets in spring and autumn gloom;
A face, flowerlike may be and moonlike too; but beauty all for whom?</p></div> </div>
