<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Ying-Ch'un's, which referred
to an article of use:</p><p>Exhaustless is the principle of heavenly calculations and of human
skill;
Skill may exist, but without proper practice the result to find hard
yet
will be!
Whence cometh all this mixed confusion on a day so still?
Simply it is because the figures Yin and Yang do not agree.</p><p>"It's an abacus," Chia Cheng observed.</p><p>"Quite so!" replied Ying Ch'un smiling; after which they also conned the
one below, by T'an-ch'un, which ran thus and had something to do with an
object:</p><p>This is the time when 'neath the stairs the pages their heads raise!
The term of "pure brightness" is the meetest time this thing to make!
The vagrant silk it snaps, and slack, without tension it strays!
The East wind don't begrudge because its farewell it did take!</p><p>"It would seem," Chia Cheng suggested, "as if that must be a kite!"</p></div> </div>
