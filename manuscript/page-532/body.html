her venerable ladyship, as well as to madame Wang."</p><p>Lady Feng signified that she would comply with her wishes, and,
forthwith leaving the apartment, she came over and sat in Mrs. Yu's
suite of rooms.</p><p>"How do you, who don't see our son's wife very often, happen to find
her?" inquired Mrs. Yu.</p><p>Lady Feng drooped her head for some time. "There's no help," she
ventured, "for this illness! but you should likewise make every
subsequent preparation, for it would also be well if you could scour it
away."</p><p>"I've done so much as to secretly give orders," replied Mrs. Yu, "to get
things ready; but for that thing (the coffin), there's no good timber to
be found, so that it will have to be looked after by and by."</p><p>Lady Feng swallowed hastily a cup of tea, and after a short chat, "I
must be hurrying back," she remarked, "to deliver my message to our
dowager lady!"</p></div> </div>
