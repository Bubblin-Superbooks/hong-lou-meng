remarked: "Now, Miss Lin, don't you urge him on; you should after all,
give him good advice, as he may, I think, listen to a good deal of what
you say to him."</p><p>"Why should I urge him on?" rejoined Lin Tai-y�, with a sarcastic smile,
"nor will I trouble myself to give him advice. You, old lady, are far
too scrupulous! Old lady Chia has also time after time given him wine,
and if he now takes a cup or two more here, at his aunt's, lady Hs�eh's
house, there's no harm that I can see. Is it perhaps, who knows, that
aunt is a stranger in this establishment, and that we have in fact no
right to come over here to see her?"</p><p>Nurse Li was both vexed and amused by the words she had just heard.
"Really," she observed, "every remark this girl Lin utters is sharper
than a razor! I didn't say anything much!"</p></div> </div>
