question. There's however one thing that I must report to you, master
Secundus. Yesterday, some Mr. Y�n Erh or other came to see you; but as I
thought you, sir, had no leisure, I speedily bade Pei Ming tell him to
come early to-day. But you unexpectedly went over again to the mansion
of the Prince of Pei Ching."</p></div> </div>
