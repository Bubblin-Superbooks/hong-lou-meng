he again gets into a huff, you, old lady, must, on your own motion,
confess to having eaten it, and not involve us in any way as to have to
bear his resentment."</p><p>Nurse Li, at these words, felt both angry and ashamed. "I can't
believe," she forthwith remarked, "that he has become so bad at heart!
Not to speak of the milk I've had, I have, in fact every right to even
something more expensive than this; for is it likely that he holds Hsi
Jen dearer than myself? It can't forsooth be that he doesn't bear in
mind how that I've brought him up to be a big man, and how that he has
eaten my blood transformed into milk and grown up to this age! and will
be because I'm now having a bowl of milk of his be angry on that score!
I shall, yes, eat it, and we'll see what he'll do! I don't know what you
people think of Hsi Jen, but she was a lowbred girl, whom I've with my
own hands raised up! and what fine object indeed was she!"</p></div> </div>
