speedily went to carry out her orders.</p><p>Not long after three nurses and five or six waiting-maids were seen
ushering in three young ladies. The first was somewhat plump in figure
and of medium height; her cheeks had a congealed appearance, like a
fresh lichee; her nose was glossy like goose fat. She was gracious,
demure, and lovable to look at.</p><p>The second had sloping shoulders, and a slim waist. Tall and slender was
she in stature, with a face like the egg of a goose. Her eyes so
beautiful, with their well-curved eyebrows, possessed in their gaze a
bewitching flash. At the very sight of her refined and elegant manners
all idea of vulgarity was forgotten.</p><p>The third was below the medium size, and her mien was, as yet,
childlike.</p><p>In their head ornaments, jewelry, and dress, the get-up of the three
young ladies was identical.</p></div> </div>
