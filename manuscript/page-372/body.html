your eldest brother, Chia Cheng, he too doesn't notice him. It's all
because when he was young he followed our ancestor in three or four
wars, and because on one occasion, by extracting our senior from the
heap of slain and carrying him on his back, he saved his life. He
himself suffered hunger and stole food for his master to eat; they had
no water for two days; and when he did get half a bowl, he gave it to
his master, while he himself had sewage water. He now simply presumes
upon the sentimental obligations imposed by these services. When the
seniors of the family still lived, they all looked upon him with
exceptional regard; but who at present ventures to interfere with him?
He is also advanced in years, and doesn't care about any decent manners;
his sole delight is wine; and when he gets drunk, there isn't a single
person whom he won't abuse. I've again and again told the stewards not
to henceforward ask Chiao</p></div> </div>
