appeared, together with two neophytes, Chih Shan and Chih Neng, to
receive them. After they had exchanged greetings, lady Feng and the
others entered the "chaste" apartments to change their clothes and wash
their hands; and when they had done, as she perceived how much taller in

invite several head-nuns to read during three days the service for the
churching of women, with the result that we've been so very busy and had
so little leisure, that we couldn't come over to pay our respects</p></div> </div>
