steps, verdant trees and limpid pools—a spot where actually no trace of
any human being could be met with, where of the shifting mundane dust
little had penetrated.</p><p>Pao-y� felt, in his dream, quite delighted. "This place," he mused, "is
pleasant, and I may as well spend my whole lifetime in here! though I
may have to lose my home, I'm quite ready for the sacrifice, for it's
far better being here than being flogged, day after day, by father,
mother, and teacher."</p><p>While he pondered in this erratic strain, he suddenly heard the voice of
some human being at the back of the rocks, giving vent to this song:</p><p>Like scattering clouds doth fleet a vernal dream;
The transient flowers pass like a running stream;
Maidens and youths bear this, ye all, in mind;
In useless grief what profit will ye find?</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Pao-y� perceived that the voice was that of a girl.</p></div> </div>
