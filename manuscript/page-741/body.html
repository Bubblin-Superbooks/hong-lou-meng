the test, by his being told to write devices for scrolls and
tablets.
Yuan Ch'un returns to the Jung Kuo mansion, on a visit to her parents,
and offers her congratulations to them on the feast of lanterns,
on the fifteenth of the first moon.</p><p>Ch'in Chung, to resume our story, departed this life, and Pao-y� went on

before he desisted; but on his return home he was still exceedingly
disconsolate.</p></div> </div>
