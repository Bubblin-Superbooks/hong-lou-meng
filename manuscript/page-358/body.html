tell madame Wang that she was off, and then went to say good-bye to
dowager lady Chia; but when Pao-y� heard where she was going, he also
wished to go; and as lady Feng had no help but to give in, and to wait
until he had changed his clothes, the sister and brother-in-law got into
a carriage, and in a short while entered the Ning mansion.</p><p>Mrs. Yu, the wife of Chia Chen, and Mrs. Ch'in, the wife of Mr. Chia
Jung, the two sisters-in-law, had, along with a number of maids,
waiting-girls, and other servants, come as far as the ceremonial gate to
receive them, and Mrs. Yu, upon meeting lady Feng, for a while indulged,
as was her wont, in humorous remarks, after which, leading Pao-y� by the
hand, they entered the drawing room and took their seats, Mrs. Ch'in
handed tea round.</p></div> </div>
