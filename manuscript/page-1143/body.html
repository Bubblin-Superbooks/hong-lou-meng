walked up to him, and took the cup from his grasp, to the intense
surprise, in fact, of Pao-y�, who inquired: "Where were you that you
have suddenly come to give me a start?"</p><p>The waiting-maid smiled as she handed him the tea. "I was in the back
court," she replied, "and just came in from the back door of the inner
rooms; and is it likely that you didn't, sir, hear the sound of my
footsteps?"</p><p>Pao-y� drank his tea, and as he simultaneously passed the servant-girl
under a minute inspection, he found that though she wore several
articles of clothing the worse for wear, she was, nevertheless, with
that head of beautiful hair, as black as the plumage of a raven, done up
in curls, her face so oblong, her figure so slim and elegant, indeed,
supremely beautiful, sweet, and spruce, and Pao-y� eagerly inquired:
"Are you also a girl attached to this room of mine?"</p><p>"I am," rejoined that waiting-maid.</p></div> </div>
