short while back, she handed it over to Tai-y� to examine. Tai-y�, on
perusal, discovered that Pao-y� had composed it, at the spur of the
moment, when under the influence of resentment; and she could not help
thinking it both a matter of ridicule as well as of regret; but she
hastily explained to Hsi Jen: "This is written for fun, and there's
nothing of any consequence in it!" and having concluded this remark, she
readily took it along with her to her room, where she conned it over in
company with Hsiang-y�n; handing it also the next day to Pao-ch'ai to
peruse. The burden of what Pao-ch'ai read was:</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">In what was no concern of mine, I should to thee have paid no heed,
For while I humour this, that one to please I don't succeed!
Act as thy wish may be! go, come whene'er thou list; 'tis naught to
me.
Sorrow or joy,</p></div> </div>
