eyes were like sparkling stars; and that he was, in very truth, a human
being full of graceful charms.</p><p>Pao-y� hastily pressed forward and made a reverent obeisance, and Shih
Jung lost no time in extending his arms from inside the sedan-chair, and
embracing him. At a glance, he saw that Pao-y� had on his head a silver

that his waist was encircled by a silver belt, inlaid with pearls; that
his face resembled vernal flowers and that his eyes were like drops of
lacquer.</p><p>Shih Jung smiled. "Your name is," he said, "no trumped-up story; for
