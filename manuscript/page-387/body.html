Pao Ch'ai seated on the couch, busy over some needlework. On the top of
her head was gathered, and made into a knot, her chevelure, black as
lacquer, and glossy like pomade. She wore a honey-coloured wadded robe,
a rose-brown short-sleeved jacket, lined with the fur of the squirrel of

not pencilled, were yet blue black; her face resembled a silver basin,
and her eyes, juicy plums. She was sparing in her words, chary in her

quiet in the acquittal of her duties and scrupulous as to the proper
season for everything. "I practise simplicity," she would say of
herself.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"How are you? are you quite well again, sister?"</p></div> </div>
