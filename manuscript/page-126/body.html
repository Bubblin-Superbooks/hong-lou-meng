the youths stepped back and retired. The matrons came forward, raised
the screen, and supported Tai-y� to descend from the chair.</p><p>Lin Tai-y� entered the door with the creepers, resting on the hand of a
matron.</p><p>On both sides was a verandah, like two outstretched arms. An Entrance
Hall stood in the centre, in the middle of which was a door-screen of Ta
Li marble, set in an ebony frame. On the other side of this screen were
three very small halls. At the back of these came at once an extensive
courtyard, belonging to the main building.</p><p>In the front part were five parlours, the frieze of the ceiling of which
was all carved, and the pillars ornamented. On either side, were covered
avenues, resembling passages through a rock. In the side-rooms were
suspended cages, full of parrots of every colour, thrushes, and birds of
every description.</p></div> </div>
