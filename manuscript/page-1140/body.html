receive the warrant. On his arrival outside the court, he commissioned a
servant to announce him, and Ts'ai Ming thereupon walked out, and merely
asking for the receipt, went in, and, after filling in the amount, the
year and moon, he handed it over to Chia Y�n together with the warrant.
Chia Y�n received them from him, and as the entry consisted of two

The next day, at the fifth watch, Chia Yun first came in search of Ni
Erh, to whom he repaid the money, and then taking fifty taels along with
him, he sped outside the western gate to the house of Fang Ch'un, a
gardener, to purchase trees, where we will leave him without saying
anything more about him.</p></div> </div>
