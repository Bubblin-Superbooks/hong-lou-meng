the Major came unexpectedly to hear of the news; and without even
looking thoroughly into the matter, they there and then had recourse to
insult and abuse. 'Is a girl,' they insinuated, 'to be promised to the

friendly terms with your honourable family, and could one solicit madame
Wang to put in a word with Mr. Chia Cheng to send a letter and ask Mr.
Y�n to speak to that Major, I have no fear that he will not agree.
