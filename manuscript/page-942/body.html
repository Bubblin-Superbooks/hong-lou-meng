glass, so that the two of them faced each other in it, and Pao-y�
readily observed as he gazed in the glass, "In the whole number of rooms
she's the only one who has a glib tongue!"</p><p>She Y�eh at these words hastily waved her hand towards the inside of the
glass, and Pao-y� understood the hint; and suddenly a sound of "hu" was
heard from the portiere, and Ch'ing Wen ran in once again.</p><p>"How have I got a glib tongue?" she inquired; "it would be well for us
to explain ourselves."</p><p>"Go after your business, and have done," She Y�eh interposed laughingly;
"what's the use of your coming and asking questions of people?"</p><p>"Will you also screen him?" Ch'ing Wen smiled significantly; "I know all
about your secret doings, but wait until I've got back my capital, and
we'll then talk matters over!"</p></div> </div>
