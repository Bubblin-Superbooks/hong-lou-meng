her, and I expect, it must be for her to cut some piece of cloth or
other." But while she yet spoke, they perceived a whole bevy of people,
pressing round lady Feng, as she egressed from the apartment.</p><p>Chia Y�n was perfectly aware that lady Feng took pleasure in flattery,
and delighted in display, so that hastily dropping his arms, he with all
reverence, thrust himself forward and paid his respects to her. But lady
Feng did not even so much as turn to look at him with straight eyes; but
continued, as hitherto, her way onwards, simply confining herself to
ascertaining whether his mother was all right, and adding: "How is it
that she doesn't come to our house for a stroll?"</p><p>"The thing is," Chia Y�n replied, "that she's not well: she, however,
often thinks fondly of you, aunt, and longs to see you; but as for
coming round, she's quite unable to do so."</p></div> </div>
