can't attend to them myself;" which said, they hastily passed over into
the room on the eastern side.</p><p>Lady Feng having again called Mrs. Chou, asked her: "When you first
informed madame about them, what did she say?" "Our Lady observed,"
replied Chou Jui's wife, "that they don't really belong to the same
family; that, in former years, their grandfather was an official at the
same place as our old master; that hence it came that they joined
ancestors; that these few years there hasn't been much intercourse
(between their family and ours); that some years back, whenever they
came on a visit, they were never permitted to go empty-handed, and that
as their coming on this occasion to see us is also a kind attention on
their part, they shouldn't be slighted. If they've anything to say,"
(our lady continued), "tell lady Secunda to do the necessary, and that
will be right."</p></div> </div>
