have their mutual friendships; while I, poor fellow, all forlorn, have
none to care a rap for me."</p><p>His remarks had reached this clause, when inadvertently the tears
trickled down; and Hsi Jen realising the state of mind he was in, did
not venture to say anything further. But as soon as Pao-y� had reflected
minutely over the sense and import of this sentence, he could not
refrain from bursting forth into a loud fit of crying, and, turning

And when there's naught to put, we could say, to the test,
We will a place set up on</p></div> </div>
