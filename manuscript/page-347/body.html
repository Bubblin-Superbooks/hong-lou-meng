upon madame Wang, my superior went over to pay a visit in the mansion of
Mr. Y�, and told me to wait for her here."</p><p>"Have you received," further asked Mrs. Chou, "the monthly allowance for
incense offering due on the fifteenth or not?"</p><p>"I can't say," replied Chih Neng.</p><p>"Who's now in charge of the issue of the monthly allowances to the
various temples?" interposed Hsi Ch'un, addressing Mrs. Chou, as soon as
she heard what was said.</p><p>"It's Y� Hsin," replied Chou Jui's wife, "who's intrusted with the
charge."</p><p>"That's how it is," observed Hsi Ch'un with a chuckle; "soon after the
arrival of the Superior, Y� Hsin's wife came over and kept on whispering
with her for some time; so I presume it must have been about this
allowance."</p></div> </div>
