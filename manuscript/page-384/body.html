down their arms against their sides. One of them alone, a certain
butler, called Ch'ien Hua, promptly came forward, as he had not seen
Pao-y� for many a day, and bending on one knee, paid his respects to
Pao-y�. Pao-y� at once gave a smile and pulled him up.</p><p>"The day before yesterday," smiled all the bystanders, "we were
somewhere together and saw some characters written by you, master
Secundus, in the composite style. The writing is certainly better than
it was before! When will you give us a few sheets to stick on the wall?"</p><p>"Where did you see them?" inquired Pao-y�, with a grin.</p><p>"They are to be found in more than one place," they replied, "and every
one praises them very much, and what's more, asks us for a few."</p></div> </div>
