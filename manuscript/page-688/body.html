mentioning transpired during the night.</p><p>On the next day, Pao-y� perceiving that the repairs to the outer
schoolroom had been completed, settled with Ch'in Chung that they should
have evening classes. But as it happened that Ch'in Chung, who was
naturally of an extremely delicate physique, caught somewhat of a chill
in the country and clandestinely indulged, besides, in an intimacy with
Chih Neng, which unavoidably made him fail to take good care of himself,
he was, shortly after his return, troubled with a cough and a feverish
cold, with nausea for drink and food, and fell into such an extremely
poor state of health that he simply kept indoors and nursed himself, and
was not in a fit condition to go to school. Pao-y�'s spirits were
readily damped, but as there was likewise no remedy he had no other
course than to wait until his complete recovery, before he could make
any arrangements.</p></div> </div>
