passages to Chia Lien's house. They came in the first instance into the
side pavilion, where Chou Jui's wife placed old goody Liu to wait a
little, while she herself went ahead, past the screen-wall and into the
entrance of the court.</p><p>Hearing that lady Feng had not come out, she went in search of an
elderly waiting-maid of lady Feng, P'ing Erh by name, who enjoyed her
confidence, to whom Chou Jui's wife first recounted from beginning to

her obeisance. In days gone by, our lady used often to meet her, so

brought her in! I'll wait here for lady Feng to come down, and explain
everything to her; and I trust she'll not call me to task for officious
rudeness."</p></div> </div>
