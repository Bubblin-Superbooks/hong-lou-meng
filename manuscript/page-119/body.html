after all of one and the same family as your worthy self, for he is the
grandson of the Duke Jung. My elder brother-in-law has now inherited the
status of Captain-General of the first grade. His name is She, his style
Ngen-hou. My second brother-in-law's name is Cheng, his style is
Tzu-chou. His present post is that of a Second class Secretary in the
Board of Works. He is modest and kindhearted, and has much in him of the
habits of his grandfather; not one of that purse-proud and haughty kind
of men. That is why I have written to him and made the request on your

slur upon your honest purpose, honourable brother, but I myself likewise
would not have been as prompt in taking action."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">When Yï¿½-ts'un heard these remarks, he at length credited what had been
