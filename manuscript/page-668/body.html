(water moon); but as good bread was made in that temple, it gave rise to
this nickname.</p><p>This convent was not very distant from the Temple of the Iron Fence, so
that as soon as the bonzes brought their functions to a close, and the
sacrifice of evening was offered, Chia Chen asked Chia Jung to request
lady Feng to retire to rest; and as lady Feng perceived that there still
remained several sisters-in-law to keep company to the female relatives,
she readily, of her own accord, took leave of the whole party, and,
along with Pao-y� and Ch'in Chung, came to the Water Moon Convent.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Ch'in Yeh, it must be noticed, was advanced in years and a victim to
many ailments, so that he was unable to remain in the temple long, and
he bade Ch'in Chung tarry until the coffin had been set in its resting
place, with the result that Ch'in Chung came along, at the same time as
lady Feng and Pao-y�, to the Water Moon</p></div> </div>
