he laughed, "but if I do guess right, I must in like manner receive a
reward!"</p><p>"This goes without saying!" dowager lady Chia added; whereupon she went
on to recite:</p><p>The monkey's body gently rests on the tree top!</p><p>"This refers," she said, "to the name of a fruit."</p><p>Chia Cheng was already aware that it was a lichee, but he designedly
made a few guesses at random, and was fined several things; but he
subsequently gave, at length, the right answer, and also obtained a
